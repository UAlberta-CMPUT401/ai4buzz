# Project Requirements

## Executive Summary

This project is to develop a web service to allow researchers to gain insight into the meanings and semantics of what makes a social media post more influential. Specifically, this project will expose a web REST API to allow researchers at AI4Society to upload images and retrieve a summary of an analysis of that photo. This analysis may contain anything from a color scheme analysis to sentiment classification of the photo.

## Project Glossary

- **AI4Society** One of the five Signature Areas of Research and Teaching of the University of Alberta, and is focused on Artificial Intelligence, its applications, and its transformative role for our society.
- **Sentiment Analysis** The process of computational analysis to identify and categorize a particular photos attitude/sentiment.
- **Dendrogram** a tree diagram, especially one showing taxonomic relationships.
- **Base 64** Base64 is a binary to a text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It is designed to carry data stored in binary format across the network channels.
- **Batch processing** When data is processed in large quantities (e.g. uploading a large amount of files) within a certain timespan where the amount of data provided is finite and known beforehand. The results are then provided after the job is completed.
- **Streaming processing** This is when data is streamed to the system in real time; the analysis of each data inputted should be returned after a few milliseconds/seconds. The amount of data is not known beforehand and can theoretically be infinite and thus the input graph is dynamic rather than static.
- **Convolution neural network** A class of artificial neural networks used in image recognition that is specifically used to process pixel data.
- **Dense Classifier** In a neural network, each node in each layer (except for the input layer) is connected to each of the nodes in the previous layer, hence making it dense.
- **Web user** User accessing the website and its features from the frontend web client.
- **Researcher** a researcher is a user from AI4Society gaining information about images.
