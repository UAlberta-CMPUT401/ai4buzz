# Project Requirements

## Executive Summary

This project is to develop a web service to allow researchers to gain insight into the meanings and semantics of what makes a social media post more influential. Specifically, this project will expose a web REST API to allow researchers at AI4Society to upload images and retrieve a summary of an analysis of that photo. This analysis may contain anything from a color scheme analysis to sentiment classification of the photo.
