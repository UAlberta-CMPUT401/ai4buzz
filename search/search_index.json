Specifically, this project will expose a web REST API to allow researchers at AI4Society to upload images and retrieve a summary of an analysis of that photo. This analysis may contain anything from a color scheme analysis to sentiment classification of the photo. Project Glossary AI4Society One of the five Signature Areas of Research and Teaching of the University of Alberta, and is focused on Artificial Intelligence, its applications, and its transformative role for our society. Sentiment Analysis The process of computational analysis to identify and categorize a particular photos attitude/sentiment. Dendrogram a tree diagram, especially one showing taxonomic relationships. Base 64 Base64 is a binary to a text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It is designed to carry data stored in binary format across the network channels. Batch processing When data is processed in large quantities (e.g. uploading a large amount of files) within a certain timespan where the amount of data provided is finite and known beforehand. The results are then provided after the job is completed. Streaming processing This is when data is streamed to the system in real time; the analysis of each data inputted should be returned after a few milliseconds/seconds. The amount of data is not known beforehand and can theoretically be infinite and thus the input graph is dynamic rather than static. Convolution neural network A class of artificial neural networks used in image recognition that is specifically used to process pixel data. Dense Classifier In a neural network, each node in each layer (except for the input layer) is connected to each of the nodes in the previous layer, hence making it dense. Web user User accessing the website and its features from the frontend web client. Researcher a researcher is a user from AI4Society gaining information about images. User Stories US 1.01 - REST API and Database setup As a researcher, I want to register myself in the database when I initially set up the API, so that images are analyzed with those who have permission Acceptance Tests Expose endpoint that allows for the upload of multiple images Throw an error if the user tries to send data that is not of the expected format Only allow registered users to acess other endpoints US 1.02 - Image analysis result As a researcher, I want to retrieve the results of the analysis using a web API, so that I can run my own analysis on the results Acceptance Tests Return analysis of the results in JSON format as a response to an image upload request US 1.03 - Generate Dendrogram As a researcher, I want to retrieve a dendrogram of a batch of images using a web API so that I can further understand the images Acceptance Tests Return dendrogram as a base 64 encoded string as a response to a dendrogram request US 1.04 - Generate collage As a researcher, I want to retrieve a collage of images using a web API so that I can further understand them. Acceptance Tests Return collage as a base 64 encoded string as a response to a dendrogram request US 1.05 - Colour scheme analysis As a researcher, I want to get the colour scheme analysis of an image so that I can know how color affects popularity of an image. Acceptance Tests Given an image, return colour scheme analysis in response body of image upload request US 1.06 - Image sentiment classification As a researcher, I want to get the sentiment classification of an image so that I can know the mood of the image. Acceptance Tests Given an image, return the sentiment of the image as a string Need to ensure 70-80% accuracy US 1.07 - Object detection As a researcher, I want to be able to know the objects detected in a photo so that I can know the contents of the image. Acceptance Tests Returns the number of objects in photo Return the bounding box coordinates of those objects in the image Return labels of those objects Need to ensure 80-90% accuracy US 1.08 - Facial Detection As a researcher, I want to be able to know the number of faces detected in a photo so that I can know how the number of people affects popularity. Acceptance Tests Returns the number of faces in photo Return the bounding box coordinates of those faces in the image Need to ensure 80-90% accuracy US 1.09 - Text extraction As a researcher, I want to be able to know if an image contains text and what that text is so that I can analyze the text in the image. Acceptance Tests Extracts text from an image Need to ensure 80-90% accuracy US 1.10 - Batch processing As a researcher, I want to be able to upload more than one image to a web service, so that I can get batch image analysis in real time. Acceptance Tests Allow client to upload more than one image to the web service Allow for images to be sent to backend and results to be sent back US 1.11 - Text Detection As a researcher, I want to detect if an image has text in it so that I can analyze the impact the presence of text has in an images popularity Acceptance Tests Model correctly detects whether there is text in an image or not Ensure model accuracy better than 80% US 2.01 - Web client image upload As a web user, I want to upload one or many images, so that the images can be analyzed Acceptance Tests Allow user to select images by selecting a single image or directory of images from their local machine to upload Ensure that image(s) are uploaded as base 64 strings US 2.02 - Web client analysis As a web user, I want to view the results of the analysis, so that I can see the features about an image to gain understanding about it. Acceptance Tests List the results of the analysis beside the image(s) that were uploaded Allow user to browse through the uploaded images and their results by scrolling through or clicking through the images US 2.03 - Web client view collage As a web user, I want to view a collage of the images so that I can do aggregate analysis. Acceptance Tests Ensure that collage renders properly on the frontend client On clicking a button, the collage should render US 2.04 - Web client View Dendrogram As a web user, I want to view a dendrogram of the images so that I can understand the relationship between them. Acceptance Tests Need to ensure dendrogram is rendered on the frontend client on click of a button Need to ensure dendrogram is rendered correctly US 2.05 - Web client authentication As a web user, I want to authenticate with my email so that I can access the website and its features. Acceptance Tests If user inputs correct info, it allows them onto the website If the user inputs incorrect information, it declines entry onto website US 2.06 - Web client JSON download As a web user, I want to be able to generate an entire report of the features above in a JSON file, so I can use the file to do additional analysis. Acceptance Tests Allow web user to download the report as a json file on click of a download button Ensure that user can only request a download if they have uploaded an image(s) for analysis MoSCoW Must Have US 1.01 - REST API and Database setup US 1.02 - Image analysis results US 1.05 - Color scheme analysis US 1.06 - Image sentiment classification US 1.07 - Object detection US 1.08 - Facial detection US 1.11 - Text Detection Should Have US 2.01 - Webclient image upload US 2.02 - Webclient analysis US 1.04 - Generate Collage US 2.03 - Web client view collage US 2.05 - Web client authentication US 2.06 - Web client JSON download US 1.10 - Batch processing Could Have US 1.03 - Generate Dendrogram US 2.04 - Web client view dendrogram US 1.09 - Text extraction Would Like but Won\u2019t get None Similar Products Google Vision AI API Cloud based image detection and classification service.
